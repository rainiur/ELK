#  Elastic Agent Ubuntu Install Steps using apt
#		by David Walden (Rainiur)
#  These steps will: 
#  Add the Elastic Repository to apt
#  Download and install the elastic agent
#  Download the certificate from the server via scp
#       (This script will register a self-signed cert if you are using a 3rd party signed cert delete --insecure from the elastic-agent install)
#  Add the certificate
#  And run the install to register it to your Fleet manager
#
#  You will need the following
#		- ssh credentials, filename and IP for the server with your cert 
#			(best to copy the cert to the root directory of the user)
#		- IP address of your Fleet Server
#		- Token for the policy to apply to the system

## Download and install the GPG Key for the Elastic Repository
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -

## Add apt-transport-https to enable https downloads for apt
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https -y

## Add Elastic repository to the apt sources.list file
echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list

## Update the repositories
sudo apt-get update -y

## Install the elastic agent
sudo apt-get install elastic-agent -y

## Download the cert and add the the shared certs directory
sudo scp <username>@<Server IP>:<filename i.e. ca.crt> .
sudo mv ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
# OR #
sudo scp <username>@<Server IP>:ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/

## Add the cert
sudo update-ca-certificates

## Since the agent was installed via apt we just need to enroll with the Fleet Server
sudo elastic-agent enroll -f --url=https://<Fleet Server IP>:8220 --insecure --enrollment-token=<Policy Token>

## Restart and enable the service
sudo systemctl start elastic-agent.service
sudo systemctl enable elastic-agent.service
